### What If I Don't Have Enough Experience?

-HAVE this mentality mind when applying for jobs and apply to job where you feel you are underqualifiedfor the jobs .As if  a job is asking you to do something that you already feel you are confident then what are you going to learn at that job .(as how you will learn , how will you grow ) . as that will improve you and add value to your resume.


1) Experience just doesn't come from working at a company , There are other things for example --


a) Github (show that you are regular), contribute in open source projects.
(go to zero To Mastery open source)

b) Have  a Personal website.( use template to bring your website)  ex creative tim , mashup template.com , Portfolio

c) 1, 2 Big Project.

d) Blog 


DO ANY 2 , 3 things atleast.

## LinkedIn

2. Add keywords to your LinkedIn profile.
3. Get endorsements.
4. Get recommendations.
5. Make connections.

## Portfolio

1. Showcase projects and links.
2. Ensure it looks nice and loads fast.

---

## Email

1. If you are applying directly via company's website or through a  job portal .This is not the best way .
2. 30% of jobs come from referrals.(networking)
3. Apply 1st to companies where friends work .(easier chances of getting referals)
3.1) Anyway apply to the company you want to work and ask for referal from connection as  They will refer a good employee as they get incentives.
4. Do cold emails using tools like Hunter.


	Example email.

`Hey $BOB,
I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
$COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
or $ROLE. Id love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?

Thanks,
Yourname
Your website or any public profile link`


SO , **IN CONCLUSION**  

-when applying to a job send an email to that person use `HUNTER` to get their email and also message them in linkedin and give them a polite message and show them your personal website , and write why you want to work for that company and ask them if you can get an  interview.
**MESSAGE THIS msg to hr , cto or lead developer**
  Let them know you are interested in getting where they are professionally and ask them if they can come for coffee or lunch.

-DO not ask directly job .

-THIS WORKS BEST FOR small company.
