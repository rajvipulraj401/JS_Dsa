# Data  Structure

## what is a dara structure?

A Data structure is a `collectiion of values and they  have relationship among those values and the functionality or relation that  can be applied to the data` .

## why we have so  many of data structure ?

 Each one is Different in what it can do and what it is used for . 

example -

Need an ordered list with `fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?`
Use a `linked list!`

Working with
`map/location data?`
Use a `graph!`

`Web scraping nested HTML?
Use a tree!`

`Need to write a scheduler?
Use a binary heap!`

NOTE - Each Data structure is good and can be used for different things so there is no such thing as  best data structure .

Algorithm are steps or processes we use to manipulate this collection of values .

`DataStructure +Algorithms = Programs`




## What do they do?

1) How to build one? 

2) How to use it and when?


## Types of operation we want to do on Data structures for which we use different data structures .

1) Access.

2) Traversal

3) Searching

4) Sorting

5) Insertion

6) Deletion

Each language has built in data types 
for exp in javascript

num

"strings"

true

undefined

and each language has data structure to store these data types.

for example in `javascript we have built in data structure`.

`[] and {}`  . 


 We can also build in our own


NOte - ` WE HAVE TO LEARN WHEN AND WHY WE want to use them`
